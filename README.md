> # project_library
phew , it took way loner that i expected , i really did forget a lot of js and had to revisit a lot of topics , and still , i hate how bad error handling is in js 

 > # does it work  ?
well yes it does , but the only issue is that you can only delete books in the same order you added them , that a bug and i'm already burnde out of this project , maybe i will fix later , it's like any one would use this shit , it's about learning javascript 
> # where is the css file ? 
I didn't make one , i just used **pico.css** framework , it's really simple and clean , don't judge me , it's time to learn js
